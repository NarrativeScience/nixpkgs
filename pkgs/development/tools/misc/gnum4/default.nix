      longDescription = ''
        GNU M4 is an implementation of the traditional Unix macro
        processor.  It is mostly SVR4 compatible although it has some
        extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional
        parameters to macros).  GNU M4 also has built-in functions for
        including files, running shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.

        GNU M4 is a macro processor in the sense that it copies its
        input to the output expanding macros as it goes.  Macros are
        either builtin or user-defined and can take any number of
        arguments.  Besides just doing macro expansion, m4 has builtin
        functions for including named files, running UNIX commands,
        doing integer arithmetic, manipulating text in various ways,
        recursion etc...  m4 can be used either as a front-end to a
        compiler or as a macro processor in its own right.
